        I interned as a React Native developer in the organisation. I
        worked on building cross platform applications using React
        Native. Since the technology was new to me, it provided a great
        working and learning experience. I worked in a team, and was
        consistently guided by my supervisor to overcome my
        shortcomings. We had two tasks at hand:
        <ul>
            <li>
                {' '}
                Import one of the existing apps from Ionic Framework to React
                Native
            </li>
            <li>
                {' '}
                Develop and Implement a new EPOD (Electronic Proof of Delivery) application
            </li>
        </ul></div>

        I interned as a Software developer in the organisation. I worked
        on building a desktop application for the organisation for the
        purpose of canteen management. I planned and developed the
        complete application on my own with some feedback from my
        colleagues and help from my seniors. I developed the application
        using JavaFx. The main idea was to:
        <ul>
            <li> Reduce labour load and paper wastage</li>
            <li> Efficient and easy to use interface</li>
        </ul></div>
